The "transparent-layers-distinction" file shows the distinction between using a black/white partly transparent layer between the background and the text. The top row has a lighter text color while the bottom row has a darker text color. The top left photograph has a white background with fifteen percent opaqueness. The top middle left photograph has a white background with thirty percent opaqueness. The top middle right photograph has a black background with fifteen percent opaqueness. The top left photograph has a black background with thirty percent opaqueness. Eacgh of the photographs on the bottom row has the same layer colors and layer color opaqueness as the photograph directly above it in the top row. This file was created in the draft stage of the poster, hence the non-computer-generated-render of a VEX robot.

The "original-render-966-iterations" file shows the original render from the Autodesk Inventor file. A total of 966 iterations were completed while processing the render. After rendering, the file was edited, changing the blue to a transparent layer. The edited file is called "edited-966-iterations"
